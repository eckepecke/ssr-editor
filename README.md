# Choice of frontend framework

We have chosen React as our framework for this project. We feel like
React is a relevant skill to learn, there is a lot of written guides as well as video tutorials
that we can learn from. This is also true for Angular and others but our understanding is that Angular is used in bigger
applications and that React is more suited to the size of application that we are going to build.
